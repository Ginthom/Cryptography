  -Notes: Using this tool with lower case letters and other signs can lead to mistakes 
          when decrypting, due to ascii-characters being used in the algorythm.
          These can break when copy/pasting or alter the command arguments.
          This happens, when certain symbols like ", /, \, etc. are part of the Cypher.
